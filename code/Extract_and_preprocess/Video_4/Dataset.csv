W2TE0DjdNqI,UgwhCBWO74Ywrhv8yAF4AaABAg,Nobody's  gonna  read  this    Or  just  a  few  people    But  I  need  to  get  it  out  of  my  chest      You  may  think  life  is  bad    right  now    That  the  world  is  going  insane    nothing  makes  sense  anymore    madness  strives    and  every  bit  of  sanity  keeping  you  alive  is  slowly  disappearing    Maybe    At  least  that's  what  I  think    Those  last  three  years  have  been  horrendously  terrible  for  me    and  I  don't  feel  happy  anymore    I  feel  like  my  entire  body  is  slowly  dying    that  I'm  losing  all  hope    everything  is  going  to  be  over  soon    For  me    and  for  everyone    It's  scary    I'm  almost  25    and  here's  where  I  am    I  envy  people  who  feel  genuinely  happy  and  hopeful  about  the  future    I  want  to  be  like  them      But  there's  this  song    I  listen  to  it  at  least  three  times  a  day    It's  a  song  that  makes  me  feel  like  even  if  everything  ends  tomorrow    even  if  we  all  just  die  and  the  infinitely  small  rock  we're  on  just  dissapears    at  least  we  were  there    We  existed    We  didn't  leave  a  trace    we  had  no  importance    no  significance    But  we  were  there    We  were  alive    we  built  towns    civilisations    we  build  bonds    families    we  fell  in  love    felt  anger    sadness    and  in  the  grand  scheme  of  the  universe    it  was  insignificant    It  was  nothing    a  mere  grain  of  sand  But  for  us    that  grain  of  sand  was  everything      Nobody  will  remember  we  even  existed    And  that's  okay    As  long  as  we  cherished  it    and  we  did  all  we  could  to  make  this  the  most  beautiful  grain  of  sand  in  the  universe      Don't  be  afraid  of  what's  to  come    But  make  sure  the  road  to  it  stays  beautiful    So  when  the  end  comes    we  can  all  look  back  and  smile  ,1099
W2TE0DjdNqI,UgySfiwaYNvtTmfbMM14AaABAg,Within  my  relatively  short  life    I  have  lost  the  friendship  of  three  incredible  people    Three  times    I  have  been  threatened    that  if  I  told  anybody    that  if  I  tried  to  stop  them  they  would  never  speak  to  me  again    That  if  I  did  not  let  them  commit  suicide    they  would  hate  me  forever    so  that  if  I  were  a    good  friend      I  would  let  them  do  what  they  wanted    Three  times  in  my  life    I  have  uttered  words  of  my  true  feelings      I  would  rather  you  live  your  life  hating  me    than  not  have  your  life  to  live  at  all      Three  times  I  have  done  what  had  to  be  done    and  saved  their  lives  at  the  cost  of  their  friendship      There's  over  100  000  comments    so  the  chance  of  anyone  seeing  this  is  astronomically  low    let  alone  any  of  them    But  if    by  some  semblance  of  chance    any  of  you  do  find  this    I  never  once  regretted  my  actions    and  I  hope  you  are  still  well    I  hope  you  live  your  best  life    even  if  that  is  a  life  without  me  in  it  anymore  ,2136

W2TE0DjdNqI,Ugzi19weqTO1vmOGfO94AaABAg,The  real  story  behind  this  song    The  Earth  became  uninhabitable    You  could  no  longer  see  the  vibrant  colors  in  the  sky  when  the  sun  rose  in  the  morning  and  set  in  the  night    The  temperatures  skyrocketed  above  the  average  to  the  point  where  if  you  stepped  outside    your  skin  would  fry  in  a  few  minutes    Fires  tore  through  forests  and  demolished  farms    The  roads  were  littered  with  animal  carcasses    sometimes  even  humans        Humanity  was  forced  to  leave    forced  to  live  in  space  for  hundreds  of  years    Billions  were  left  behind  to  die  on  Earth    Only  the  lucky  ones  were  able  to  escape  into  space    but  really    nobody  was  lucky  in  the  end    The  survivors  in  the  space  station  were  never  happy  and  were  always  waiting  for  the  day  when  they  would  be  allowed  back  on  Earth      That  day  finally  came  after  four  hundred  years    A  completely  new  generation  of  humans  had  been  born    still  longing  to  go  to  Earth    The  government  officials  had  gathered  everyone  together  and  announced  they  would  be  sending  one  trainee  to  Earth  to  check  the  conditions    Doubtful  whispered  passed  through  the  crowd    some  claiming  it  was  a    suicide  mission          The  officials  hushed  the  crowd  till  their  voices  became  whispers    Then  they  spoke      Daniel  Farewall  has  been  assigned  the  mission  by  the  President          A  cry  rang  out  among  the  mass  of  people    All  eyes  turned  to  a  woman  standing  in  the  back    Her  eyes  were  glossy  and  her  face  was  thin    framed  by  short  black  hair    It  was  Petunia  Farewall    Daniel  s  mother          He  s  just  a  boy      She  cried  out    clenching  her  fists          Daniel  is  the  right  one  for  the  job    ma  am      the  official  responded    his  voice  monotone        Petunia  shoved  her  way  through  the  crowd    tears  sliding  down  her  cheeks    till  she  reached  the  front      He  s  all  I  have    Please    you  can  t  do  this          I  m  afraid  we  can      the  officer  said    a  light  mocking  in  his  tone    He  raised  one  gloved  hand  in  the  air  and  two  officials  joined  Petunia  at  her  side    grabbing  her  by  each  arm    They  coaxed  her  from  the  room    ignoring  her  cries  of  desperation    The  crowd  was  deathly  silent          It  has  been  settled    Daniel  Farewall  will  go  to  Earth  this  coming  full  moon              The  second  week  of  October  had  passed  and  the  moon  was  shining  through  the  space  station  windows    Daniel  was  getting  ready  in  the  boarding  deck  after  he  had  said  his  goodbyes  to  his  friends  and  family    He  felt  quite  honored  to  have  been  chosen  for  this  position    Random  people  would  pat  his  shoulder  or  give  a  slight  nod  in  his  direction  as  he  passed  by    He  didn  t  understand  why  everyone  had  been  so  emotional  saying  goodbye    He  was  coming  back    wasn  t  he      As  the  general  handed  him  his  instructions  for  when  he  arrived  on  Earth    he  adjusted  Daniel  s  helmet  on  his  head      Try  to  get  as  much  information  as  you  can      the  general  said      Daniel  nodded    then  said      Should  I  bring  back  Earth  samples    Maybe  I  could  collect  some  dirt    or  maybe  a  plant    if  there  are  any        The  general  laughed  bitterly        Bring  back      There  s  no  way  back  up  from  the  Transport  Pod    Farewall          What  do  you  mean          You  re  staying  down  there          For  how  long          However  long  it  takes  for  you  to  die    Days    hours    or  seconds    who  knows        Daniel  s  eyes  widened  as  he  took  a  step  back  in  surprise      I  don  t  understand    sir    This  wasn  t  part  of  my  training        The  general  gripped  his  shoulder  and  pulled  him  toward  two  metal  doors  that  slid  open  when  they  got  near      Don  t  forget  to  keep  us  updated    You  have  that  intercom  in  your  suit  for  a  reason        Before  Daniel  could  reply    he  was  pushed  into  the  Transport  Pod  and  the  doors  closed  behind  him    He  stood    unmoving    for  a  moment    his  thoughts  running  through  his  brain    He  turned  to  the  metal  doors  and  pounded  his  fists  on  them        Please  let  me  out    Anyone      he  cried    but  got  no  response      After  a  minute  of  silence    he  let  out  a  sigh  and  sat  down  in  the  fresh  leather  chair  in  the  center  of  the  pod    He  ran  his  fingers  across  the  dashboard    tapping  buttons  and  flicking  switches  with  blurry  eyesight  until  the  pod  began  to  rumble    Daniel  clenched  the  armrests  and  pressed  himself  into  the  back  of  his  chair    The  Transport  Pod  slowly  detached  from  the  space  station    Blinking  his  watery  eyes  away    Daniel  braced  himself  for  what  was  about  to  come              A  sharp  pain  in  Daniel  s  head  and  the  smell  of  smoke  woke  him    Ever  so  slightly    he  regained  his  vision    His  head  was  rested  across  the  dashboard  of  the  pod    his  body  barely  hanging  onto  the  edge  of  the  chair    Wires  had  fallen  from  the  roof    the  front  window  was  cracked  and  glass  was  scattered  everywhere    Once  he  became  aware  of  the  situation    he  wondered  how  he  had  survived    Daniel  quickly  realized  that  something  was  dripping  down  his  uncovered  forehead    He  looked  around  the  pod  for  his  helmet  and  found  it  lying  in  the  back    broken  and  splattered  with  thick  red  liquid        He  wiped  his  forehead  and  looked  at  his  hand    He  let  out  a  little  yelp  of  surprise    seeing  that  his  hand  was  completely  drenched  in  blood    Daniel  quickly  stood  up  and  leaned  against  the  wall    He  pried  open  the  door  and  squinted  as  the  harsh  sunlight  hit  his  face      Earth  wasn  t  how  Daniel  imagined  it    The  air  was  thick  and  cloudy    The  sky  was  a  deathly  crimson  color  and  the  sun  looked  huge    bigger  than  it  ever  had  from  the  space  station    Daniel  figured  whatever  was  on  the  ground  was  once  grass    but  it  didn  t  look  like  the  grass  in  the  station  s  greenhouse    It  was  shriveled  and  dry  and  the  ground  underneath  it  was  cracked  and  dusty    He  seemed  to  have  landed  in  an  open  field    but  he  could  see  the  outline  of  barren  trees  in  the  distance    Everything  seemed  so  different  then  what  Daniel  had  seen  in  pictures    but  for  some  reason    he  couldn  t  help  but  smile        He  raised  his  finger  to  tap  the  intercom  button  on  his  suit    but  then  stopped    The  government  sent  him  here  to  die  just  so  they  could  get  some  information  about  Earth    They  knew  Earth  was  still  dangerous        His  smile  disappeared  quickly  and  he  began  to  slowly  walk  away  from  the  pod  and  towards  the  trees    He  reached  the  top  of  a  small  hill  and  discovered  a  measly  broken  down  hut  on  the  other  side      As  the  sun  scorched  his  skin  and  head  pounding    he  descended  the  hill  and  made  his  way  towards  it        When  Daniel  reached  for  the  door  handle    the  door  completely  fell  off  its  hinges  and  into  the  hut    Dust  flew  up  from  every  corner  of  the  one  room  house    sending  Daniel  into  a  coughing  fit  and  a  sharp  pain  to  his  forehead    Inside  the  hut    there  was  a  little  cot  in  the  corner  and  a  desk  beside  it    Mold  had  taken  over  almost  every  part  of  the  floor  and  parts  of  the  walls        Daniel  stepped  inside  and  sat  down  on  the  old  cot    He  pulled  open  a  few  drawers  in  the  desk  until  he  found  something        A  small    rectangular  object  was  placed  in  the  very  back  of  the  bottom  drawer    He  gently  picked  it  up  and  held  it  close  to  his  face    blinking  sweat  and  blood  off  his  eyelashes    There  was  a  piece  of  tape  stuck  to  it    and  written  on  the  tape  were  the  words    goodbye  to  a  world      He  studied  the  six  buttons  on  the  object    recognizing  the  symbols    He  pressed  the  button  that  had  a  triangle  on  it    assuming  it  was  the    play    button    As  soon  as  he  pressed  it    two  little  wheels  started  to  turn  inside  and  a  voice  came  from  the  device          Thank  you    I  ll  say  goodbye  soon      It  was  a  woman    Her  voice  sounded  shaky      Though  it's  the  end  of  the  world    don  t  blame  yourself        The  woman  stopped  speaking  for  a  moment  to  take  a  strangled  breath          And  if  it's  true    I  will  surround  you  and  give  life  to  a  world  that  s  our  own          The  recording  ended  too  soon    Daniel  hugged  it  to  his  chest  and  sighed    He  wondered  how  long  the  device  had  been  sitting  in  the  hut    He  wiped  some  blood  off  of  his  neck  and  pressed  play  again    This  time    the  women  s  voice  was  slightly  staticy        He  listened  to  the  recording  again      Then  a  fourth  time      Daniel  had  lost  count  of  how  many  times  he  replayed  the  woman  s  voice    When  he  pressed  the  play  button  again    he  could  no  longer  make  out  her  words    but  he  knew  them    The  voice  no  longer  sounded  like  a  woman    It  was  staticy  and  distorted    like  a  robot  s  voice        Daniel  tried  to  press  play    but  nothing  happened    He  clenched  the  recorder  in  his  hand  and  stood  up  abruptly    throwing  it  against  the  wall  in  a  fit  of  anger    The  recorder  shattered  into  pieces    shards  of  plastic  flying  across  the  room        He  sighed    falling  to  his  knees    Images  of  his  family    friends    and  their  goodbyes  flickered  through  his  mind    He  wanted  to  go  back        But  he  couldn  t        He  brought  his  hands  up  to  his  face  and  clutched  his  head    He  heard  the  sound  of  his  hair  squish  when  he  touched  it    It  was  blood              Daniel  collapsed  onto  the  floor    Overcome  with  exhaustion    he  decided  to  rest    With  the  woman  s  voice  replaying  in  his  head    his  eyes  closed  as  he  muttered  her  words        Thank  you  for  taking  time  in  reading  this      For  a  less  sad  story  Lmao  here      hey  guys  we're  a  team  right          No    we're  a  clan        Nah    we're  a  family

W2TE0DjdNqI,UgwZbnH8zpE6WE7DZc54AaABAg,The  song  ends  how  it  began    but  it's  different    You  hear  the  same  lyrics  in  the  song    but  every  single  time  it  replays  it  gets  more  diluted  and  robotic    By  the  end  of  the  song  it's  just  beeps  and  sounds    But  it  holds  some  impact    even  in  that  state  you  understand  what  it's  trying  to  say    and  with  any  background  noise  leaving  just  the    lyrics    to  listen  to  making  it  seem  even  more  important    It's  sheer  genius  on  the  psychological  level    every  piece  of  this  song  is  unexplained  and  it  leaves  you  to  create  a  world  that's  your  own    With  that  said    I'd  like  to  explain  what  I  got  from  this  song    To  me  there's  this  distance    this  sort  of  gap  between  the  listener  and  the  singer    It  almost  feels  like  the  singer  is  on  some  sort  of  call  that  you  keep  getting  further  away  from    Like  you're  leaving  the  range  and  instead  of  cutting  out    it  distorts  and  changes  to  become  something  less  meaningful    less  genuine    especially  with  it  repeated    it  seems  to  lose  meaning    and  some  kind  of  human  quality  to  it    It's  similar  to  how  after  you  repeat  a  word  enough  it  begins  to  become  meaningless    void  of  something    but  you  don't  know  what    To  me    this  song  is  about  loneliness  and  isolation    even  though  someone  is  there  for  you    they  repeat    and  what  they're  saying  becomes  meaningless    the  listener  just  moves  further  into  their  isolation  and  starts  to  failing  to  see  the  singer  as  human    The  singer  is  trying  desperately  to  reach  out  to  the  listener    but  each  time  it  becomes  more  and  more  robotic    lacking  empathy    I  don't  think  it's  the  literal  end  of  the  world  either    the  listener  may  have  done  something  in  the  past  and  ended  up  isolating  themselves  and  continuing  to  play  that  in  their  head  until  they  are  lost  in  that  memory    they  ended  their  own  world    now  they  are  lost  to  it  and  fall  further  until  there  is  no  hope  of  recovery  ,625
